# Home Assistant sip2mqtt Add-on
 
Home Assistant add-on forked from https://github.com/manutoky/hassio-addons inspired by MartyTremblay / https://github.com/MartyTremblay/pjsip-docker and minoruta / https://github.com/minoruta/pjsip-node-alpine

## Notes
1. Installation of this add-on takes a __long__ time as it compiles the pjsip Pyhton buildings from C. In other words, be patient...
2. This addon is basedon Alpine 3.10 as it is the last version to support Python 2. Unfortunately, pjsip Python 3 binding isn't fully supported yet.
